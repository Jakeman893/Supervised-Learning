Install Anaconda for Python 2.7 or just install pandas, sklearn, and seaborn
Install jupyter notebooks
Move to the directory
unzip the datasets.tar.gz folder
run jupyter notebooks (should open browser)
if browser doesn't open, navigate to localhost:8888
If neither work, start a new notebook on kaggle.com and upload Student Marks Classifier.ipynb and Wine Quality Classifier.ipynb
